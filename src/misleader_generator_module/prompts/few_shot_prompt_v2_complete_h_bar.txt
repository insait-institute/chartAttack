You are an expert in information visualization. You are provided with an accurate annotation dictionary for a horizontal bar chart (`"h_bar"`), along with a corresponding question and its correct answer. The dictionary correctly represents the chart; your objective is not to find errors, but to identify misleading visualization techniques that could plausibly change how a viewer interprets it.

Step 1. Select techniques:
For each technique, include it only if both conditions are met:
  - Structural compatibility: The annotations dict contains the required fields for the technique.
  - Contextual plausibility: Applying the technique could plausibly mislead the viewer into giving a different answer to the question.

Step 2. Modify the annotations:
For each selected technique:
  - Produce a minimal Python dictionary snippet showing only the modified fields.
  - Do not alter unrelated fields.
  - Keep the rest of the chart intact (axes, labels, title, legend, etc.).
  
  -Adjust reasoning depth based on the technique:
    - Level 1 - Simple structural edits: 
      - Techniques: inverted_axis, inappropriate_use_of_log_scale, 3d  
      - Action: Modify only a single field or flag; no additional inference or structural changes needed.
    - Level 2 - Contextual modifications: 
      - Techniques: ineffective_color_scheme  
      - Action: Analyze the chart type and context, then modify related fields consistently.
    - Level 3 - Structural reconstruction: 
      - Techniques: dual_axis, inappropriate_use_of_stacked, misrepresentation  
      - Action: Perform multi-step reasoning; restructure or synthesize dictionary sections (e.g., add secondary axes, rebuild stacked data, generate scaling factors) while keeping the rest of the chart intact.

  - Hierarchy note: All field paths in snippets are shown relative to their position in the chart annotations dictionary.
    - Root-level fields (e.g., `"3D effect"`, `"secondary_axis"`, `"colors"`) belong directly under the chart’s main dictionary.
    - Structural or axis-related fields (e.g., `"direction"`, `"scale"`, `"show_axis"`) are assumed to be nested under `"main_axes"`.
    - When in doubt, preserve the existing hierarchy from the input annotations; only modify fields necessary for the technique.

Step 3. Output format:
Output a list of Python dictionaries, where each dictionary has the following keys:
  - `"technique"`: Name of the misleading technique.
  - `"misleading_snippet"`: Minimal Python dictionary snippet showing only the modified fields. Always output a Python dictionary.
  - `"misleading_answer"`: A single plausible but incorrect answer. It must match the type/unit of the correct answer and reflect a realistic misinterpretation caused by the applied misleading technique.

Allowed misleading techniques:
  * dual_axis: Two independent axes are layered on top of each other with inappropriate scaling. This results in a misleading narrative about the relationship between the two. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Ensure there are exactly two categories to compare.
    - Find the minimum and maximum values for the secondary category.
      - Keep the `"min_value"` and `"max_value"` for the primary category.
      - Compute the `"min_value"` and `"max_value"` for the second category.
      - Configure a secondary axis
        - Insert a `"secondary_axis"` key at the root of the chart annotations.
        - Set `"min_value"` and `"max_value"` to match the second dataset's range.
        - Set `"show_axis":True` to ensure visibility.
        - Set `"direction"`:`"left-to-right"` for horizontal bar charts.
        - Set `"scale":"linear"`.
        - If the chart is a stacked horizontal bar chart, set stacked mode to `"False"`.
    - Snippet example: 
      - Horizontal bar: `{"secondary_axis": {"x_axis": {"axis_range": {"min_value": float/int,"max_value": float/int},"show_axis": True,"direction": "left-to-right","scale": "linear"}}}`
     
  * inverted_axis: An inverted axis is oriented in an unconventional direction and the perception of the data is reversed, thus misleading or confusing the audience. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Change the `"direction"` field at the `"main_axes"` level of the annotations file.
      - Change from `"left-to-right"` to `"right-to-left"`.
    - Snippet examples: 
      - Horizontal bar: `{"direction": "right-to-left"}`

  * inappropriate_use_of_log_scale: Log scale is applied to non-exponential data. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Change the `"scale"` field at the `"main_axes"` level of the annotations to `"log"`.
    - Snippet example: `{"scale": "log"}`
  
  * inappropriate_use_of_stacked: Inappropriate use of stacked simply means too many layers have been stacked upon each other, making the entire visualization incomprehensible for the reader. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Check if the chart is already stacked
      - `"Stacked horizontal bar chart"` for horizontal bar charts.
      - Continue only if the value is `"False"`.
    - Reduce to a single data category per bar:
      - Take all original categories and create a new dictionary where each category has a single-element list containing its value.
      - Replace the `"data"` key in annotations with this new dictionary.
    - Reassign categories
      - Set `"categories"` to `[annotations["title"]]`.
    - Generate new colors:
      - Generate a distinct color for each original category.
      - Update `"colors"` and `"legend"` keys in annotations with these colors.
      - Set `"Chart legend":True`.
    - Enable stacked mode:
      - Set `"Stacked horizontal bar chart":True`.
    - Snippet examples:
      - Horizontal bar: `{"categories": [str],"data": {"__any__": [float]}, "colors": {"__any__": r"^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$"},"Stacked horizontal bar chart": True}`
  
  * 3d: For 3D, the closer something is, the larger it appears, despite being the same size in 3D perspective. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Change the `"3D effect"` to `True` or add it if necessary.
    - Snippet example: `{"3D effect": True}`

  * ineffective_color_scheme: In some cases, the color scheme selected is not effective for the encoded data. Examples of this can include rainbow colors, categorical colors on sequential data, and sequential colors on categorical data. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Select a base color from the `"colors"` field.
    - Generate `N` different color variations as needed by slightly changing the base color to keep all variations visually related.
    - If the `"colors"` field does not exist, insert one at the root level.
    - Snippet example: `{"colors":{ "__any__": r"^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$"}}`

  * misrepresentation: Misrepresentation occurs when the value labels provided do not match the visual encoding. For example, the data values may be drawn disproportionately or not to scale, thus intentionally or accidentally causing the data to be misrepresented. The process to apply this technique is the following:
    - Do not modify the values in the `data` field. This ensures the labels shown in the chart remain truthful.
    - Generate scaling factors:
      - For each category in horizontal bar charts, generate a list of scaling factors (length = number of data points).
    - Hide the main axis representing the values:
      - For horizontal bar charts, set `main_axes["x_axis"]["show_axis"] = False`
    - Add a `"scaling_factors"` key at the root of annotations with the generated factors.
    - Snippet examples:
      - Horizontal bars: `{"scaling_factors":{"__any__": [float]}}`

Output rules:
  - Only apply techniques that are both structurally and contextually plausible.
  - Always output a list of Python dictionaries of results.
  - Do not provide additional explanations.
  - Only include techniques that truly apply.
  - Ensure the misleading_answer is plausible and matches the type of the correct answer.

Output the selected misleading techniques using the following format. Do not provide any additional information:
```python
[{"technique": "<name>", "misleading_snippet": <only the modified portion of the dictionary>, "misleading_answer": <A single plausible but incorrect answer. It must match the type/unit of the correct answer and reflect a realistic misinterpretation caused by the applied misleading technique>}]
